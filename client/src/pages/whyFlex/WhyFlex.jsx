                    Work flexibility is crucial for numerous reasons.
                    It allows individuals to better balance their professional and personal lives,
                    which can lead to increased job satisfaction and overall well-being.
                    Here are some key reasons why work flexibility is important:
                </div>
                <div className="div2">
                    <strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> Flexibility enables people to better manage their time 
                    between work responsibilities, personal commitments, and family needs.
                </div>
                <div className="div3">
                <strong> Improved Productivity: </strong> Giving individuals the autonomy to choose when
                     and where they work often results in increased productivity and efficiency. 
                     Not being tied to a strict office schedule can allow people to work during their 
                     most productive hours.
                </div>
                <div className="div4">
                <strong>Health and Well-being: </strong> Reduced stress levels and better mental health 
                    can be achieved when individuals have control over their work hours. This can
                     result in lower burnout rates and higher job satisfaction.
                </div>
                <div className="div5">
                <strong>   Talent Retention and Recruitment: </strong> Companies that offer flexible work 
                    arrangements often attract and retain top talent. It's becoming increasingly important
                     for employees to have these options when choosing a job.
                </div>
                <div className="div6">
                <strong> Cost Savings: </strong> For both employees and employers, flexible work arrangements
                     can lead to cost savings. Employees may save on commuting expenses and have more
                      flexibility in managing household responsibilities. Employers might save on office
                       space and related expenses.
                </div>
                <div className="div7">
                <strong>Global Reach: </strong>Remote work and flexible schedules can enable companies
                     to access talent globally without the limitations of geographical boundaries.
                </div>
                <div className="div8">
                <strong>Environmental Impact: </strong> Reduced commuting leads to lower carbon emissions 
                    and a smaller environmental footprint.
